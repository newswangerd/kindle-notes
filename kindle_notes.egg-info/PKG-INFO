        # Usage
        
        ## Taking Notes
        
        `kindle-notes` allows insterting some basic formatting on your kindle while you're taking notes. For example, highlighting a piece of text and adding `-` or `#`, `##`, `###`... etc will format the highlighted block of text with the selected markdown formatter.
        
        For example highlighting "Example Heading" with `##` will result in:
        
        ```markdown
        ## Example Heading
        ```
        
        In your exported notes. This can be used to mark chapter titles and subheadings to make it easier to get around your notes.
        
        ## Exporting Notes
        
        To export your notes, simply copy the `My Clippings.txt` file off of your kindle and run the following commands
        
        ```shell
        
        ```
